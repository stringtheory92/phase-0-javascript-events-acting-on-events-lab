First time playing around with js events. Used phase-0-javascript-events-acting-on-events-lab as jumping-off point to explore other style alterations on 'keydown' events, including:

 jumpLeft(), 
 jumpRight(), 
 jumpToTop(), 
 jumpToBottom(), 
 and dodger icon colors programmed to number keys. 

 This is also practice adding commits through terminal.
